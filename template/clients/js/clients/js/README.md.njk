# JavaScript client

A generated JavaScript library for the {{ programName | titleCase }} program.

## Getting started

To build and test your JavaScript client from the root of the repository, you may use the following command.

```sh
{{ getNpmCommand("clients:js:test") }}
```

This will start a new local validator, if one is not already running, and run the tests for your JavaScript client.

## Available client scripts.

Alternatively, you can go into the client directory and run the tests directly.

```sh
# Build your programs and start the validator.
{{ getNpmCommand("programs:build") }}
{{ getNpmCommand("validator") }}

# Go into the client directory and run the tests.
cd clients/js
{{ getNpmCommand("install") }}
{{ getNpmCommand("build") }}
{{ getNpmCommand("test") }}
```

You may also use the following scripts to lint and/or format your JavaScript client.

```sh
{{ getNpmCommand("lint") }}
{{ getNpmCommand("lint:fix") }}
{{ getNpmCommand("format") }}
{{ getNpmCommand("format:fix") }}
```
